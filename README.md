Python image based on Ubuntu

Since Official Python Docker Repository doesn't provide any image which based on Ubuntu, I have to create it by my own. This Dockerfile is 99.9% similar with official Python Dockerfile.

The reason why Python team doesn't create any Ubuntu-based image is the size of the image (~500M), compare to just ~250M of 'python:stretch', is a huge pain of security.
